SOSHILAND - THE BOARD GAME

=======================================

Soshiland is a board game created for entertainment purposes for the
SoCal Christmas Party in December 2010. It is based off of Hasbro's
Monopoly and features untouchable properties up for grabs! It is a quest
to conquer Soshiland, but with a wicked economical twist. Be prepared to
get bankrupted ><

=======================================

A Quick Briefing:

In Soshiland, each of the girls have 4 properties
under their name (total is 36 properties belonging to the girls). In
addition to that, the two "utilities" are Forever 9 & Soshi Bond. What
used to be Go is now Soshi Dorm, Jail is now Babysitting Kyungsan, Free
Parking is now Fanmeeting, and Go To Jail is now Go Babysit Kyungsan.
Community Chest & Chance remain the same. The board has been expanded to
now be 13x13 (instead of the original 10x10).
